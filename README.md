# Using as notebook and code repo for PHYS 128 project
### Katherine La and Rebecca Nishide

Each notebook is titled by [YearMonthDay] numbers followed by a brief desription. 

These notebooks contain all my code, figures, and results 

# Me and Katherine split up work such that I did the heavy coding and she did literature review, background work, found results and conclusions from my modeling, and error analysis. Her notebook looks very different than mine but we split up the work evenly in a way that worked for us.
